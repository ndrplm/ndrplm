## 🎵 A bit more about me

I’m passionate about music and love being at the crossroads of tech and culture.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me at a gig, practicing drums, or unwinding with a cozy game of Stardew Valley 🎧🥁🌱

Creativity shapes the way I think 💡 I’m happiest when I’m making something, whether it’s with code, sound, or my hands.  
I love learning new things and genuinely enjoy sharing what I know, especially through mentoring and helping others grow.

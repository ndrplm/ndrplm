# 👋 Hi, I'm Andréa !

I'm a *oat milk latte fueled* frontend engineer who loves building useful, intuitive products.

I started my career in the live music industry, then retrained as a software engineer in 2018. Since then, I’ve been working across music tech, SaaS, and startups to bring ideas to life through clean, thoughtful interfaces.

## 🎵 A bit more about me

I’m passionate about music and love working at the intersection of tech and culture. 

When I’m not coding, I’m probably at a gig, playing Stardew Valley, or practicing drums. I care deeply about clean code, clear design, and building things that feel -and look- good to use.
